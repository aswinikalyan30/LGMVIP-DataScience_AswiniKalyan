**WHAT IS LSTM?**
-LSTM is a special type of neural network which has a memory cell, this memory cell is being updated by 3 gates.
-Input gate: It just adds the information to the neural network
-Forget gate: It forgets the unnecessary data feed into the network
-Output gate: It going to get the desired answer out of the neural network.

The input data is passed into the neural network and is updated for every input data

We normalize the data using ![MinMaxScaler](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html)
Used Keras to build the stacked LSTM model
